              The Art Stable is your inner city sanctuary in the heart of the
              creative Cuba quarter in Wellington, the ‘coolest little capital’
              in the world. Located in a building that started life in the 1880s
              as a stable, this boutique apartment combines quality, character
              and culture to create distincitve accommodation - a peaceful,
              art-filled retreat in the inner city.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              For the past 12 years, the Art Stable was situated above Bartley &
              Company Art, one of the city’s leading contemporary art galleries.
              Recently the gallery moved to a bigger space nearby, across the
              park at 22 Garrett Street, but the apartment remains distinctively
              furnished with top quality art.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Totally self-contained, the Art Stable features one bedroom with a
              super king or two single beds in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the
              separate open-plan living room. Double glazing and luxurious
              Egyptian cotton sheets and quality linen should ensure a good
              night’s sleep. However if you open the windows sounds does come in
              and, as we are in the inner city, noise at night is inevitable. We
              do provide earplugs for those who need them.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              A full kitchen, with light breakfast provisions, is available. If
              you have special dietary requirements, for example you are gluten
              free, please let us know and we will do our best to meet your
              needs. With so many cafes right on the doorstep, you may just want
              to eat out. The TV, on the off-chance you want a quiet evening at
              home, has Chromecast installed. If you subscribe to Netflix, Neon,
              Spark Sport or any streaming service you can cast it onto the Art
              Stable TV.

                  The owner Alison lives in the adjacent apartment. A born and
                  bred Wellingtonian, she can provide advice on all the best
                  places to see and eat as well as things to do. Just 500 metres
                  from the city’s award winning waterfront, the Art Stable
                  offers a warm retreat and easy walking access to everything
                  the city has to offer – from inner city shopping and
                  entertainment to harbour, beach and bush.

                  Most of the year, we are happy to have one night stays but
                  cannot accept these during holiday periods such as Christmas
                  and Easter and during special events in Wellington.
                </p>
